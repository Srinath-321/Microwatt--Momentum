# Neural Engine Accelerator

## Project Overview
This project suggests designing and implementing a custom **Neural Engine Accelerator** that works with the open-source Microwatt CPU core. The goal of the accelerator is to efficiently perform real-time inference of small neural networks, optimized for edge AI applications like sensor data classification. This hardware accelerator will take on neural network computations from the Microwatt CPU, enabling low-power and low-latency AI processing on embedded platforms.

Many edge computing devices need AI inference capabilities but struggle with power and performance when they depend on general-purpose processors. This project aims to fill that gap by proposing a dedicated neural engine that speeds up matrix multiplications and activation functions. This will help Microwatt-based systems handle AI tasks more effectively.

## Proposed Features
- Verilog-based neural accelerator design, focusing on fixed-point arithmetic  
- Smooth interface with the Microwatt CPU core for offloading neural computations  
- Target applications include sensor classification, anomaly detection, and low-power AI inference
